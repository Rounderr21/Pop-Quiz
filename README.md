# Pop-Quiz

# Project Description
This Project is designed to make a quiz that the user must either complete before the timer expires or the timer runs out. Challenges that I faced are trying to create functions that go together and have the function arguments and parameters match up correctly.

When you open the project you are presented with the start button. Upon clicking this button a timer starts and you are presented with a question, and answers. when the user answers a question, they are then presented with another question and set of answers. If the user answers a question incorrectly, then the quiz timer reduces by 20 seconds. If the user answers all of the questions or if the timer runs out before they can answer all questions the quiz will be over. You will then be asked to input your initials. Once you hit the submit button your score and initials will be displayed on the scoreboard. At this time you may erase the scoreboard or start the quiz over.

# HTML File
Started with no starter code. Placed the HTML file with semantic HTML tags to ensure a well-structed document. Inserted comments to breakdown the document further to make it easier to read.

# CSS File
Started with no starter code. Created CSS elements to assist the HTML & Javascript files to have a  
expansive website. Inserted comments to breakdown the document further to make it easier to read, and to inform them of where the elements are being used.

# Javascript File
Started with no starter code. Pulled elementID's from the HTML to make Functions that corresponded with one another. By doing this we ensure a smooth operation from function to function to make the process of following the code easier. Also inserted comments to breakdown the document further to make it easier to read.

# Github
Pushed out commits of the HTML, CSS, Javascript, and README when finishing any coding edits, as to ensure I could go back at anytime to earlier designs if need be.
